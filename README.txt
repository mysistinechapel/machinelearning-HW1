NOTE: Dependencies and running instructions are below. I used a grid search to find my hyperparameters for
each algorithm. When running expeirments.py, it will just run each algoruithm using the best hyperparams I
found during implementation and analysis. Per the assignment instructions, the SVM was designed to allow 
for the swapping out of kernels.
